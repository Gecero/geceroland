WHAT YOU NEED TO BUILD

1. Open eclipse. Go to File>Open Projects from file 
   system and import the "plugin" folder

2. get a copy of spigot build tools. use it to create
   a fresh spigot.jar file. by default the spigot.jar
   is supposed to be in the subdirectory of the main
   project directory, but you can change that. also,
   the spigot.jar file can be used to host a local
   server

3. edit the code by your needs and save everything.

4. now, in eclipse, go to File>Export>Java>JAR file.
   on the "resources to export" page, select the 
   "plugin" folder and plugin.yml file. Then save
   the JAR file. Put the JAR file into the plugins
   folder in your minecraft server and start it up.
